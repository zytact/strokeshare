# Strokeshare

A minimal web-based whiteboarding tool for quickly creating sketches and diagrams. Draw, save and share.

## Why?

This is similar to [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com). I wanted to work learn by doing and whiteboarding with Excalidraw is a common thing for me. So I thought, why not?
